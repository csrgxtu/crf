### 摘要
现有的针对篮球赛事的预测分析主要是使用一些简单的统计分析方法和专家人为预测分析，这些方法都存在效率低，准确率差的问题。本文旨在使用条件随机场模型来预测分析篮球比赛的结果。条件随机场模型是一种基于时间序列的统计模型，可以很好的适用于具有时序效应的篮球比赛数据中。主要通过大量的NBA比赛数据，通过有向图构建球队的之间的实力模型，使用实力值及其它相关的特征作为每个球队的特征向量，以此构建条件随机场模型来预测分析篮球比赛的胜负结果。

[The use of data mining for basketball outcome prediction](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5647440&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D5647440), 2010, Dragan Miljković; Ljubiša Gajić ; Aleksandar Kovačević ; Zora Konjović, IEEE.  
2010年，Dragan等人通过将篮球比赛预测归类为一个分类问题，通过朴素贝叶斯方法做分类，使用多元回归分析计算每场比赛的展形，实现了MVC 2 模型的软件系统。通过在2009/2010 NBA 常规赛季的778场比赛数据上训练预测，正确率可以达到大概67%。


This paper presents one such system, which uses data mining techniques in order to predict the outcomes of basketball games in NBA (National Basketball Association) league. The problem of predicting the game result is formalized as a classification problem, where the Naive Bayes method is used. Besides actual result, for each game system calculates the spread, by using multivariate linear regression. The MVC Model 2 pattern based software system is implemented. The system was evaluated on the dataset comprising 778 games from the regular part of the 2009/2010 NBA season and it correctly predicted the winners of about 67% of matches.

[A compound framework for sports results prediction: A football case study](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705108000609), 2008, Byungho Min; Jinhyuck Kim; Chongyoun Choe; Hyeonsang Eom; R.I. (Bob) McKay; Knowledge-Based Systems, Pages 551–562; ScienceDirect  
2008年， Byungho Min等人提出了一个复合框架来进行足球预测。  这个框架由两部分组成，分别是基于规则的推理和贝叶斯网络，通过考虑两部分来进行预测。主要考虑到体育比赛是高度随机的事件，并且同时一个队伍的策略可以通过一些简单的逻辑来近似。另外，因为使用了基于规则的推理，所以对于小数据量的比赛也可以做出很好的预测，相比机器学习就需要两个队伍之间有大量的比赛数据才能做出合理的预测。基于这个框架，我们实现了FRES(Football Result Expert System)并且展示了它能合理的稳定的预测。

We propose a framework for sports prediction using Bayesian inference and rule-based reasoning, together with an in-game time-series approach. The framework is novel in three ways. The framework consists of two major components: a rule-based reasoner and a Bayesian network component. The two different approaches cooperate in predicting the results of sports matches. It is motivated by the observation that sports matches are highly stochastic, but at the same time, the strategies of a team can be approximated by crisp logic rules. Furthermore, because of the rule-based component, our framework can give reasonably good predictions even when statistical data is scanty: it can be used to predict results of matches between teams which have had few previous encounters. Machine learning techniques have great difficulty in handling such situations of insufficient data. Second, our framework is able to consider many factors, such as current scores, morale, fatigue, skills, etc. when it predicts the results of sports matches: most previous work considered only one factor, usually the score. Third, in contrast to most previous work on sports results prediction, we use a knowledge-based in-game time-series approach to predict sports matches. This approach enables our framework to reflect the tides/flows of a sports match, making our predictions certainly more realistic, and somewhat more accurate. We have implemented a football results predictor called FRES (Football Result Expert System) based on this framework, and show that it gives reasonable and stable predictions.

[Using Machine Learning to Predict the Results of Sporting Matches](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267197536_Using_Machine_Learning_to_Predict_the_Results_of_Sporting_Matches); 2014; Michael Baulch; ResearchGate  
2014年，Michael Baulch使用人工智能神经网络对篮球比赛数据进行训练预测，其中使用后向算法和共轭梯度算法训练ANN网络，结果达到了很好的预测效果。

Artificial neural networks, or ANN's as they are commonly called, are used in many places throughout the world for a wide variety of applications. One of these applications is to predict results of sporting matches, and this is the section that my study was focused on. My study was concentrated directly on rugby league and basketball. By looking at the input and output data that has been entered by a user, the neural network looks at possible solutions as to how the output was achieved from the input. The ANN then tries to map these solutions to the other data points that have been entered, and checks to see how accurate it actually was. There are many different methods of training an ANN, however I focused mainly on the Backpropagation method and the Conjugate Gradient method. Training a neural network can be a very difficult task however, in this project, by taking care as to what data and methods that were used when training the network, good results were achieved.

[Artificial Intelligence in Sports Prediction](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220841301_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Sports_Prediction); Alan Mccabe, Jarrod Trevathan; 2008; ResearchGate  
2008年， Alan Mccabe等人使用一个扩展的人工智能模型来做赛事预测，该模型由多层次的感知机组成，并且使用一些特征来代表每支球队。该系统在一些情况下预测结果超过了人工预测的结果。

This paper presents an extension of earlier work in the use of artificial intelligence for prediction of sporting out- comes. An expanded model is described, as well as a broadening of the area of application of the original work. The model used is a form of multi-layer perceptron and it is presented with a number of features which attempt to capture the quality of various sporting teams. The system performs well and compares favourably with human tipsters in several environments. A study of less rigid “World Cup” formats appears, along with extensive live testing results in a major international tipping competition.

[Data mining in sports: predicting Cy Young award winners](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1229658); 	 Lloyd Smith; 2007; ACM; Journal of Computing Sciences  
2007年， Lloyd Smith使用贝叶斯分类器预测了美国青年杯棒球比赛，并且和其它两个统计模型进行比较，当没有候补投手的数据时，三个结果都比较低。

A Bayesian classifier was created to predict Cy Young Award winners in American baseball. The model was compared against two statistical models designed to perform the same task. Over the years from 1967 through 2006, the accuracy of the Bayesian classifier was similar to that of the other two models---when restricted to starting pitchers, all three were more than 80% correct. Accuracy was lower for all three models when relief pitchers were included in the data.

2009年， Juan E等人主要使用特征提取和进化计算来预测National Meet的比赛数据。特征提取使用来找出最优的特征集合，粒子群算法(Particle Swarm Optimizer)是用来找出最优的权重值集合。相比现有的系统，大概提高了0.3%。

Although some work has been done to better predict the outcome of sporting events, it has focused on mainstream sports such as football and has typically employed forecasting or machine learning techniques. This work focuses on the sport of cross-country, and uses feature selection and evolutionary computation to better predict National Meet results. Feature Selection is utilized to find the most optimal feature set and a Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO) to find the most optimal weight set. The best results are attained using the PSO, with an improvement over the current system of 2.5% for Women and 0.3% for Men.
